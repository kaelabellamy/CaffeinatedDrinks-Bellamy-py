# Personal data projects

- __Project Purpose:__ 
The goal of this project is to visualize each category of drink and how it's caffeine levels compare to the amount and calories of the drink. I chose this data because it seemed interesting and like it would challenge me, but I would still be able to understand it. I demonstrated my skills to clean it up and turn the data into what I need to create a visualization. This was simply for class and for fun.

- __Tools used:__ 
I used Python for programming. More specifically, I used the basic packages, such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. Below is a link to my data:

- __Results:__ 

From the plot I created, it is easy to see that coffe seems to have the higher content in terms of volume that people drink and the number of calories it contains. That being said, I was surprised by tea. There seems to be quite a few teas that have fairly high caffeine levels and are high in calories. It is probably the teas that are filled with sugar, but the caffeine level is still surprising.
